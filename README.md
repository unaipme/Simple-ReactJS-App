# ReactJS template app

Sample React app to run locally with `npm`. You can start building your app on top of this template if creating an app to run locally from the ground up is a pain in the ass for you as well.

To make it work, use these commands:
```
mkdir sample-app && cd sample-app
git clone https://github.com/unaipme/Simple-ReactJS-App-Template
npm install
npm install webpack --global
webpack -w
```

Now, by opening the `index.html` file with the browser, a "Hello, world!" message should show up.
